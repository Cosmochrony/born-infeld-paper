This repository contains the source of the paper on **bounded relaxation, Born–Infeld
saturation, and the dynamical selection of spacetime geometry** (paper C).

This work studies a class of **relational systems** whose effective continuum
descriptions admit a **finite maximal propagation or relaxation flux**.
We show that this minimal constraint uniquely enforces a **Born–Infeld–type effective
structure**, and that this structure dynamically selects a restricted class of
admissible operators whose continuum limits define physically meaningful spacetime
geometries.

In the revised formulation, flux saturation is not only a dynamical constraint
but also a limitation of projectability.
In saturation regimes, unresolved relational structure is not lost but re-encoded
into effective geometric and thermodynamic observables, such as curvature or
horizon temperature.
Born–Infeld saturation thus plays a dual role: it bounds admissible dynamics and
governs how information is redistributed at the level of effective descriptions.

In particular, we demonstrate that:
- **flat Minkowski spacetime** emerges as the unique homogeneous and isotropic fixed
  point of bounded relaxation,
- **Schwarzschild geometry** arises universally as the effective exterior description
  of a localized and stationary obstruction,
- **horizons** correspond to flux saturation and loss of projectability, rather than to
  physical singularities.

The analysis is entirely operator-based and does not postulate independent metric
dynamics or gravitational field equations.

## Core Claims

The paper is organized around the following statements:

1. **Bounded propagation excludes purely quadratic effective actions**  
   Any local continuum description admitting a finite maximal flux cannot be governed
   by a purely quadratic functional. Under mild assumptions, bounded propagation
   uniquely enforces a Born–Infeld–type structure.

2. **Effective geometry is selected dynamically, not postulated**  
   The bounded-flux condition restricts the class of admissible relational Laplacians
   whose continuum limits admit a geometric interpretation. The effective metric
   arises from the principal symbol of the selected operator.

3. **Minkowski spacetime emerges as a homogeneous relaxation fixed point**  
   In the absence of localized obstructions, homogeneous and isotropic relaxation
   uniquely selects a flat spacetime with pseudo-Riemannian signature \((- + + +)\),
   without assuming Lorentz invariance at the microscopic level.

4. **Schwarzschild geometry is the universal response to a localized obstruction**  
   For stationary and isotropic perturbations, flux conservation alone leads to a
   \(1/r\) profile and induces the Schwarzschild metric as the effective exterior
   geometry, independently of the microscopic details.

5. **Horizons mark loss of projectability, not physical singularities**  
   At flux saturation, the effective operator becomes degenerate and the geometric
   description ceases to apply. Horizons are interpreted as boundaries of the
   projectable regime, consistent with structural analyses of non-injective mappings.

6. **Born–Infeld saturation governs the re-encoding of unresolved structure**  
   In regimes where bounded relaxation saturates, effective geometric and
   thermodynamic quantities act as compensatory parameters, encoding relational
   degrees of freedom that cannot be resolved within a smooth spacetime
   description.

## Relation to Other Papers

- This paper builds on results concerning **spectral and relational emergence of
  geometry** developed in paper A.
- Its interpretation of horizons and strong-field regimes is conceptually aligned
  with the analysis of **non-injective effective descriptions** developed in paper B.

Each paper is logically autonomous, but together they form a coherent analysis of
emergent geometry, its limitations, and its operational meaning.

## What This Paper Does Not Assume

To avoid conflating structural and ontological claims, the paper does not assume:

- a fundamental spacetime manifold
- independent metric degrees of freedom
- Einstein field equations
- a specific microscopic ontology
- modifications of quantum mechanics

All results are derived at the level of **effective operators, symmetry constraints,
and bounded relaxation dynamics**.
