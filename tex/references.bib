  abstract = {Bell-type correlations are shown to arise as a structural consequence of
              non-injective mappings between underlying configurations and observable
              descriptions. The analysis isolates probabilistic factorization as an
              effective assumption rather than a dynamical principle, and demonstrates
              that Bell inequality violations do not require superluminal influences,
              retrocausality, or nonlocal dynamics.},
