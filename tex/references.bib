 non-injective mappings between underlying configurations and observable
 descriptions. The analysis isolates probabilistic factorization as an
 effective assumption rather than a dynamical principle, and demonstrates
 that Bell inequality violations do not require superluminal influences,
 retrocausality, or nonlocal dynamics.},
