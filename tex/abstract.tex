\abstract{We investigate the emergence and selection of effective spacetime geometry from
relational systems whose continuum descriptions admit a finite maximal propagation
or relaxation flux. We show that bounded propagation excludes purely quadratic
effective actions and uniquely enforces a Born--Infeld--type structure as the minimal
local representation compatible with flux saturation. Building on the continuum
limit of relational Laplacians, we demonstrate that this bounded-flux condition
dynamically restricts the class of admissible effective operators whose principal
symbols define meaningful metrics. In homogeneous and isotropic relaxation regimes,
  this mechanism uniquely selects flat spacetime with pseudo-Riemannian signature
  $(- + + +)$, yielding Minkowski geometry as a dynamically admissible fixed point.
  When homogeneity is broken by a localized and stationary obstruction, flux
  conservation leads generically to a $1/r$ profile and induces the Schwarzschild
  geometry as the universal effective exterior description, without postulating
  independent metric dynamics or gravitational field equations. We further show that
  horizons correspond to saturation of the bounded-flux condition and to a loss of
  projectability of the effective description, rather than to physical singularities.
  These results provide a minimal and operator-based account of flat spacetime,
  Schwarzschild geometry, and horizon formation as consequences of bounded relational
  relaxation.}
